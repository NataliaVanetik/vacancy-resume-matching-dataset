Ground truth for the first 30 vacancies (files numbered 1-30) against 5 vacancies 
given in the "5_vacancies.csv" file according to the instructions received from a senior HR specialist that appear
in the "annotation_instructions.docx" file.

Annotations by two independent annotators, for every CV vacancies 1-5 are ranked from the best (place 1 in the annotation array) to the worst (place 5 in the annotation array).
Total 30 arrays of 5 ranks for every annotator.
